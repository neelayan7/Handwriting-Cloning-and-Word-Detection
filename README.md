# Handwriting-Cloning-and-Word-Detection
## Introduction
I have basically merged two github repositories([Spatio Temporal Handwriting Imitation](https://github.com/M4rt1nM4yr/spatio-temporal_handwriting_imitation) and [EAST text detector](https://github.com/argman/EAST)) and turned them into an end-to-end handwriting cloning and word detection model.
